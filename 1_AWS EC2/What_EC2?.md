# What is AWS EC2 ?

> Stands for Amazon Elastic compute cloud
> 

A business uses a client server model to deliver data to the end user when they make request. To do this servers are required which can provide raw compute capacity to handle the requests. In AWS those servers are virtual and to access these virtual servers, EC2 servers are used. 

### Advantages

1. It is faster than setting up a server to fire up and application locally
2. It is cost effective
3. It is flexible.

EC2 runs on top with physical servers by virtualisation 

### Key points from this lesson

- You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
- You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
- You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
- You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.
